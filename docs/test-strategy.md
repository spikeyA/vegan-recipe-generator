**Test Strategy for Vegan Recipe Generator App**

---

### Overview

This document outlines the test strategy for the Vegan Recipe Generator app, which allows users to generate vegan recipes using OpenAI, search for related recipes via an API, and interact using voice input.

---

### Goals

* Ensure the app works reliably across user flows.
* Automate key functionality to detect regressions early.
* Cover key user scenarios: text input, voice input, recipe fetching, and response display.
* Maintain performance and usability under real-world conditions.

---

### Test Types

#### 1. **Unit Testing**

* **Scope:** Isolated logic like prompt generation, API response parsing, helper functions
* **Tools:** Jest, React Testing Library
* **Files to Target:**

  * `utils/helpers.js`
  * `utils/api.js`
  * Component rendering (e.g., `<RecipeOutput />`)

#### 2. **Integration Testing**

* **Scope:** Component-to-component interaction, async data fetching
* **Tools:** React Testing Library, Mock Service Worker (MSW)
* **Focus Areas:**

  * `generateRecipe()` flow in `App.js`
  * Voice input triggering the recipe generation
  * GPT output followed by recipe API fetch

#### 3. **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**

* **Scope:** Full user journey across UI
* **Tools:** Cypress or Playwright
* **Test Cases:**

  * User types in ingredient(s) and receives recipes
  * User uses voice input to search
  * Handles API failures gracefully

#### 4. **Performance Testing**

* **Scope:** Load and response time of data fetches and OpenAI calls
* **Tools:** Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, optional custom logging

---

### Test Data Strategy

* Mock data for GPT responses and vegan recipe API
* Use fixtures for consistent test runs
* Stub voice input for testing speech flows

---
#### 5. Voice Chatbot Testing (Speech Synthesis)

* Scope: Ensure that the chatbot speaks responses correctly using browser-native TTS.
* Tools:
* Manual testing on supported browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari)
* Unit tests mocking window.speechSynthesis API (if possible)
* Test Cases:
* Response from OpenAI is spoken clearly via speechSynthesis.speak()
* Voice plays only after a successful GPT or API call
* Multiple speech calls do not overlap (cancel ongoing first)
* Handles browser not supporting Speech Synthesis
* Fallback Handling:
* Graceful degradation with visual text output only
* Notification or tooltip to the user if voice is not available
---
### CI/CD Integration

* **Platform:** GitHub Actions
* **Steps:**

  * Run unit/integration tests on every PR
  * Fail builds on coverage drop
  * Linting + formatting checks

---

### Negative Testing Scenarios

* No input provided (text or voice)
* GPT returns empty/invalid output
* API call fails or times out
* Invalid recipe data format (e.g., missing title or link)

---

### Accessibility and Usability

* Verify keyboard navigation
* Test voice input fallback for unsupported browsers
* Validate text contrast and responsive layout

---

### Test Coverage Goals

* **Unit test coverage:** 80%+
* **Critical user flows:** 100% automated

---

### Conclusion

This strategy provides a balanced approach between automation and quality visibility. As a QA engineer/manager, this test coverage ensures confidence in shipping features involving AI, async workflows, and multi-modal input like voice.
